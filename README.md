Using the Hypothetical Development Approach,   determine what   should be paid for   the   site.
Then conduct a Discounted Cashflow   Feasibility (DCF) Analysis to determine      the   following:
.             Development   time   frame.:   pre-construction   (lead-in   period),   construction   and   post-   construction   (selling period)

It   is   assumed   that   the   planning   authority   has   given   positive   support   for   this   development after reviewing the preliminary design and planning   concept   in   the   pre-lodgement   meeting. 
All   inputs   and   other   assumptions   should   be   fully   given   and   explained. 
All   explanations   and   arguments   should   be properly   cited   and   a   list   of   references   should   be   provided.
